This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) TODO-list which is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First project with Pocketbase, more functionality will be added later.

TODO's:
  - Implement login for user, so each user can keep track of their own TODO-list.
  - The possibility to delete tasks.
  - Styling, just simple CSS at the moment.


Pocketbase is used as backend/storage.
